These are just little python scripts I tried today.
Did not succeed.
These are for the little red card with a W5100 chip, an ethernet connector,
and a 10-pin header for SPI.

RPi3b:
    2,4 +5V
    6,9 GND
    19 MOSI
    21 MISO
    23 CLK
    24 Spi 0 /chipSelect
    26 Spi 1 /chipSelect

I also tried pin 11 for a /reset signal, but I kept getting a warning
if I used GPIO and SPI at the same time.  So i don't know if it did
anything.   I need to try again with a breadboard in the middle,
so I can also get my Oscilloscope on these pins.
